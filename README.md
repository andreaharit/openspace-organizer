# openspace-organizer

## Description
OpenOrganizer is that randomly assigns people to seats on tables.
It asks the user for the number of tables available and how many seats are per table. 
It imports the name of the person from a CSV file and exports another CSV file with the final layout where:
    - Column 1 = Table number
    - Column 2 = Name of the person seating.
The program makes sure no one is sitting alone.
